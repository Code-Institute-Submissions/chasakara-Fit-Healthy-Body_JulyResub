## Deployment

### Local Deployment

This project is deployed on heroku: 

In order to run this project locally on your own system, you need following:

Python3 to run the application
PIP to install all requirements
GIT for cloning and version control or you can just download the repo in zip format
IDE 

Clone the repo with command git clone https://github.com/chasakara/Fit-Healthy-Body.git or donwloand the zip file

Navigate to the correct file location after unpacking the files cd <path to folder>

Create .env with pipenv shell

Install all requirements with pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

launche the project python manage.py runserver

The Django server should be running locally now on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
When running the Django server for the first time, it should create a new SQLite3 database file: db.sqlite3

Run python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate

To have an access to Django Admin Panel, you must generate a superuser:
python manage.py createsuperuser

### Remote Deployment

1. Log in (or Register) to Heroku and from your dashboard click 'new' >        'create new app'.

2. Enter your 'App name' and choose the appropriate region, then click         'Create app'.

3. Then on the 'Resources' tab, search and add on the Heroku Postgres          database.

4. To use Postgres, install dj_database_url, and psycopg2 in the project       terminal using the following commands;

       $ pip3 install dj_database_url

       $ pip3 install psycopg2

5. Freeze the requirements to ensure Heroku installs all the apps              requirements when deployed using the following command;

        $ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

6. To migrate to the Postgres, go to settings.py and add the following         import;

   import dj_database_url

7. Then down in the databases setting comment out the default configuration    and replace the default database with a call to dj_database_url.parse       and give it the database URL from Heroku.

   Config Vars

   Note: You can either get the database URL from your config variables in your app settings tab or from the command line by typing Heroku config.

7. Apply all migrations using the following command;

        $ python3 manage.py migrate

   After migrations have been applied amend your database configurations to;

   Config Vars

   Note: This will ensure that your Postgres database is used in deployment and your sqlite3 in development.

8. Create a superuser to log in with using the following command;

         $ python3 manage.py createsuperuser

9. Go to the Settings tab on Heroku, scroll to the 'Config Vars' section, and click 'Reveal Config Vars'.

    Config Vars

10. Enter the variables (key and value) contained in your environment           settings or stored in an env.py. The keys are listed below and values       are inputted by the user.

11. Install gunicorn using the following command;

        $ pip3 install gunicorn

    Then freeze into your requirements file.

12. Create a Procfile and add the following line;

    web: gunicorn fit-heatlhty-body.wsgi:application

    Note: The Procfile must be assigned a capital P.

13. Last, you need to temporarily disable collectstatic to ensure that          Heroku won't try to collect static files when we deploy. This is done       by adding the below variable;

|   DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC | 1 |

14. Add the hostname of your Heroku app to allowed hosts in settings.py

15. Now you can commit all the changes and push to GitHub;

        $ git add . 
        $ git commit -m <'your commit message'>
        $ git push

16. If you created your app on the website you will need to initialize your     Heroku git remote using the following command;

        $ heroku git:remote -a fit-heatlhty-body

17. Then use the following command to push to Heroku;

        $ git push heroku master
